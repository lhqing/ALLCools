              expression, anatomy and function, yet the regulatory DNA

              understood. Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the

              DNA methylation sequencing1,2 to profile 103,982 nuclei
              (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45
              regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and
              olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct
              spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed
              taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature
              genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These
              features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting
              the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage
              of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining
              subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in
              the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial

              variants that affect regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I

              native chromatin3-6. However, only a small fraction of such sites
              have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here,
              to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor
              footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from
              243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these
              data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that

              We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase

              occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the

              attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional

              containing RNA expression levels for thousands of genes from up
              to millions of cells. Common data analysis pipelines include a
              dimensionality reduction step for visualising the data in two
              dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed
              stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing
              local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications
              often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure
              of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how
              to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating
              more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA
              initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity
              kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use
              exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use
              published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this
              protocol yields superior results compared to the naive
              application of t-SNE.",

    abstract = "Abstract Summary Point-based visualisations of large,
              multi-dimensional data from molecular biology can reveal
              meaningful clusters. One of the most popular techniques to
              construct such visualisations is t-distributed stochastic
              neighbor embedding (t-SNE), for which a number of extensions have
              recently been proposed to address issues of scalability and the
              quality of the resulting visualisations. We introduce openTSNE, a
              modular Python library that implements the core t-SNE algorithm
              and its extensions. The library is orders of magnitude faster
              than existing popular implementations, including those from
              scikit-learn. Unique to openTSNE is also the mapping of new data
              to existing embeddings, which can surprisingly assist in solving
              batch effects.Availability openTSNE is available at

              sorted files in TAB-delimited formats such as GFF, BED, PSL, SAM
              and SQL export, and quickly retrieves features overlapping

              per query, data compression with gzip compatibility and direct
              FTP/HTTP access. Tabix is implemented as a free command-line tool
              as well as a library in C, Java, Perl and Python. It is
              particularly useful for manually examining local genomic features
              on the command line and enables genome viewers to support huge
              data files and remote custom tracks over networks. AVAILABILITY
