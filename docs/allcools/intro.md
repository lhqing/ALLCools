# ALLCools: ALL methyl-Cytosine tools

ALLCools is a software package for single-cell DNA methylome data analysis. It contains functions for cellular and genomic analysis.

## Documentation Organization

1. For installation, please read **GET STARTED** [here](start/installation.md);
2. The ALLCools workflow encompasses the following two sections:
    1. **CELLULAR ANALYSIS**: This [section](cell_level/basic/intro_basic_clustering.md) goes over basic clustering steps, differential methylated genes (DMG) analysis, data integration, and doublets identification;
    2. **GENOMIC ANALYSIS**: This [section](cluster_level/intro.md) covers differential methylated region (DMR) calling, genome annotation, DNA motif analysis, correlation analysis, and enhancer prediction;
3. To generate analysis files from your own data, please read the **COMMAND LINE TOOLS** [here](command_line/allcools.ipynb);
4. For references to function used in this package, please read the **API** [here](https://lhqing.github.io/ALLCools/api/ALLCools/index.html).
